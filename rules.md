All accounts must comply with the Code of Conduct (see above), this is non negotiable.

Bots are allowed as long as they are useful, interesting, or amusing. Bots that post excessively, that simply boost or link other posts, that just follow other users, or that produce badly-formed output will be suspended.

Accounts for non-profits, public sector organisations, or independent content creators are allowed as long as any posts they make remain within the scope and spirit of being a non-commercial account.

Commercial use (company accounts, advertising etc) is not permitted on this server, although we reserve the right to make exceptions for some companies that act in good faith.

In general, be respectful of each other and we'll all get on just fine.
