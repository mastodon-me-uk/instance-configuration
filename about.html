<h2><a name='welcome'></a>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
Welcome to Mastodon.me.uk, a social media community hosted in the UK; part of the Fediverse/ActivityPub/Mastodon federated social network, which allows you to follow users on other communities. It's a bit like Twitter but without a single company in control.</p>
<p>
If you're new to the Fediverse, the <a href='https://fedi.tips/mastodon-and-the-fediverse-beginners-start-here/'>FediTips beginners' guide</a> is a great introduction. 
</p>

<h3>Arriving from Twitter?</h3>
<p>
If you're coming from Twitter, here are a few useful tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Find people you know over there by connecting your accounts up to <a href="https://fedifinder.glitch.me/">Fedifinder</a> or <a href="https://twitodon.com/">Twitodon</a>.</li>
<li>Cross-post back Twitter with <a href="https://moa.party/">Moa Bridge</a>, if you want to stay active over there as well as here. Please don't crosspost from Twitter to here, it's not considered good etiquette.</li> 
<li>Many thing you might consider "missing features" are intentional; for instance, quoting other posts is intentionally not possible. Try to get comfy and learn a bit about the space before suggesting it should change.<li>
</ul>

<h2>Fediverse Etiquette (Fediquette?)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use content warnings on posts that people might prefer not to see (politics, most often, but you'll see many other examples). It's easy and polite.</li>
<li>Don't crosspost indiscriminately between networks.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name='moderation'></a>How We Moderate Content</h2>
<p>
The moderation team on this instance are responsible for enforcing our Code of Conduct (see below). In general, our approach is to let people say what they like (unless clearly illegal), but prevent them saying it publicly where it can hurt others. We think that's best aligned with the principles of the Fediverse as a whole.
</p>
<ol>
<li>People that clearly breach UK law (or who are considered spammers by the mods) will be removed immediately.</li>
<li>People that attack other people or groups based on who they are (<em>not</em> for what they believe) will be suspended - that basically means they'll be silenced, and fully deleted after 30 days.</li>
<li>People that post offensive content, or who post regularly without using an appropriate content warning will be limited, making their posts only visible to their followers.</li>
<li>People that have previously posted offensive content on other networks (including Twitter) may be pre-emptively moderated here, though in general we will limit rather than suspend until the accounts actually breach the guidelines on <em>this</em> network.<li>
<li>Servers that fail to meet similar standards of moderation will be limited, though we much prefer to limit individuals if we can.</li>
<li>Servers that encourage offensive content will be blocked.</li>
</ol>
<p>
These principles apply to both local users and federated content, though obviously we can only take the ultimate action to delete content for local users.
</p>
<p>
We will react to reports as quickly as we can, though please remember we are humans and cannot always respond straight away (especially at night). And of course, we can only respond if we know about infringements, so please use the report button!
</p>

orientation.</p>

<h3>Our Standards</h3>

include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
  <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>

  <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
  <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
</ul>

  <li>Public or private harassment</li>
  <li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>
  <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our Responsibilities</h3>

<p>Server admins are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>

<p>Server admins have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the administrator at <a href='https://mastodon.me.uk/@floppy'>@floppy</a>. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>

<p>Server maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.</p>
