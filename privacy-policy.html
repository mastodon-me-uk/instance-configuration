<h3>2. Data protection summary</h3>
<p>We dedicate our Mastodon instance Mastodon.me.uk to the people in the UK. Our
    small team in London provides the non-profit <a
        href="https://opencollective.com/mastodon-me-uk"
        target="_blank">donation-based</a> service on a voluntary basis to offer
    privacy-friendly micro-blogging accounts that our users typically employ for
    networking, socialising and discussing ideas general discussion for users in
    the UK.</p>
<p>For the purpose of ensuring a secure interaction, the website of
    Mastodon.me.uk stores the cookie ‘_mastodon_session’ with an identifier in
    the browser of registered and unregistered website visitors until they close
    their browser. For registered website visitors, the cookie ‘_session_id’
    stores their login status until logout. Based on user consent, the website
    stores as well push notification settings in the browser. For security and
    debugging purposes, our server logs and stores visitor IP addresses for a
    maximum of 14 days. After that time, all IP addresses are removed.</p>
<p>Mastodon.me.uk processes profile data in the form of posts (toots),
    subscriptions (following), subscribers (follower), content appreciations
    (likes) and promotions (boosts) for publication in the context of profile
    and post pages. For registered users we process your profile data to deliver
    the service. For users of other instances, we store and display public
    profile data and rely here on our legitimate interest until they object and
    in any case when they delete their post or other data (unsubscribe, unlike,
    unboost).</p>
<p>If you contact Mastodon.me.uk via email or a (private) post, we use any
    personal data that your message may contain (such as your email address or

    12 months. You are of course free to use a nickname and a pseudonymous email
    address. We process messages from our registered users to deliver the
    service and rely for users of other instances on their consent. We may also
    process messages to comply with our legal obligations.</p>

<p><strong>Scope and purpose of the processing</strong> This data protection
    notice applies to the processing of personal data for the provision of the
    microblogging service Mastodon.me.uk. It offers information on what personal
    data is processed and how it is processed, and on your data subject rights.
</p>
<p><strong>Responsible for the processing</strong> The data controller is
    Mastodon.me.uk in its capacity as the provider of the service.</p>
<h4>Processing of personal data</h4>
<p>Personal data processed by Mastodon.me.uk is accessible to its administration
    team and, where necessary, to moderators on a need-to-know basis to ensure a
    secure operation. User content is published or delivered according to the
    user settings. For the provision of the service, Mastodon.me.uk employs the
    data processors listed below that process personal data linked to the
    service solely on the written instruction from Mastodon.me.uk:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Server hosting from <a href="https://masto.host"
            target="_blank">Mastohost</a></li>
    <!-- TODO:  <li>Email notifications delivery from <a
            href="https://www.notifications-provider.com"
            target="_blank">Notifications_Provider, Provider_City</a></li>
    <li>Email mailbox from <a href="https://inbox-provider.com"
            target="_blank">Inbox_Provider, Provider_City</a></li> -->
    <li>Donations processing from <a href="https://opencollective.com/"
            target="_blank">OpenCollective, with donation host "Accountable"
            from the Social Change Nest CIC, London</a><!----></li>
</ul><strong>(a) Website Visitors</strong>
<p>The Mastodon.me.uk website and APIs process the IP addresses and other
    metadata (as specified below) of its visitors. When accessing the service,
    an encrypted connection to its web server is established. To display the
    content correctly on the visitor’s computer or other terminal devices, the
    following data is processed in accordance with the HTTP and TCP/IP protocol:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>IP address of the visitor’s internet connection</li>
    <li>Operating system and operating system version of the visitor’s terminal
    </li>
    <li>Web browser and browser version</li>
    <li>Date of access to the website</li>
    <li>HTTP cookie ‘_mastodon_session’ (for the duration of the website visit)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>This is required for the request, processing, and display of profile data and
    other content on the service. After each page visit, some of the data are
    stored in the account profile (if logged in) and server logs. These logs
    serve the purpose of maintenance and security of the server and personal
    data herein is deleted after 14 days. Furthermore, the website employs the
    cookie ‘_session_id’ to store the login status of registered users until
    logout or until a year after the last website visit. The website also stores
    the notifications settings in the browser. This processing is based on
    Article 6 (1) (b) of the GDPR (‘processing is necessary for the performance
    of a contract’). This includes processing carried out in order to comply
    with the necessary technical and organisational protection measures.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Contributors from third-party services</strong></p>
<p>Mastodon.me.uk processes personal data when users of third-party services
    with ActivityPub support interact with its accounts. To enrich public
    profile pages with profile data, the following data is processed in
    accordance with the requirements of the ActivityPub protocol:</p>
<ul>
    <li>IP address of the third-party service</li>
    <li>Name of the user’s terminal software</li>
    <li>Display name, account name, and profile picture</li>
    <li>Current date and time</li>
    <li>Profile data</li>
</ul>
<p>Private messages are not end-to-end encrypted and are therefore in principle
    accessible to the Mastodon.me.uk administrators.</p>
<p>This processing is necessary to provide a federated Mastodon instance and
    therefore based on Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (‘processing is in our legitimate
    interest’) with the exception of personal data that is not required such as
    the display name and profile picture, the processing of which is based on
    Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR (‘consent’). Mastodon.me.uk stores profile data from
    subscriptions from compatible third-party services until it receives via
    that service or directly from the user a request for deletion or objection
    (unsubscribe, unlike, unboost).</p><strong>(c) Registered users</strong>
<p>Mastodon.me.uk limits registrations to users it assumes to be
    people in the UK. Mastodon.me.uk reserves the right to refuse the provision
    of the service to any given user for any reason. To set up accounts and
    manage them subsequently, the following data from registered users is
    processed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Display name, account name, profile picture and header image </li>
    <li>Login credentials consisting of an email address </li>
    <li>Account description/biography </li>
    <li>Content (toots), promoted, and appreciated content </li>
    <li>Private messages (sent and received) </li>
    <li>Subscriptions and their recent content </li>
    <li>Logged-in sessions (terminal software, time and date, IP address) </li>
</ul>
<p>If registered users post profile data, the previous section applies
    accordingly. Note that updating subscribers and posting profile data
    (including profile mentions) requires disclosure of personal data to the
    service of the recipients. Depending on their Mastodon server’s geographic
    location, the disclosure can possibly involve international data transfers
    that are outside of Mastodon.me.uk’s control.</p>
<p>The registered user’s name and display name, profile picture and header,
    description, subscriptions, the own and promoted content, the content of
    their subscriptions, as well as their given feedback is published on their
    profile page.</p>
<p>This processing is based on Article 6 (1) (b) of the GDPR (‘processing is
    necessary for the performance of a contract’) with the exception of personal
    data that is not required such as the display name and profile picture, the
    processing of which is based on Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR (‘consent’). Profile
    data is retained until the account is deleted.</p>
<p>Registered users are responsible for the use of their accounts and their own
    compliance with the GDPR as separate controllers when they post personal
    data of other people.</p><strong>(d) Donations via OpenCollective</strong>
<p>Users can make donations for the operation of Mastodon.me.uk via OpenCollective,
    which processes personal data according to their own data protection notice.
</p><strong>(e) Contacting us by email</strong>
<p>If you contact Mastodon.me.uk via email or a Mastodon private message, any
    personal data that your message may contain (such as your email address or
    name) will only be used to respond to your message and may be stored as part
    of an email archive. You are of course free to use a nickname and a
    pseudonymous email address. Such personal data will be deleted after 12
    months.</p>

    of your personal data or restriction of processing concerning you or, where

    portability. Where applicable, you also have the right to withdraw your
